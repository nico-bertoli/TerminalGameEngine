# TerminalGameEngine
A simple engine for making 2D terminal games.

- Framerate-independent simulation
- Collision system, objects expose 'OnCollisionEnter' and 'OnCollisionEnd' methods
- simulation print on terminal system (animated backgrounds, ui message over game)
- Audio manager for playing sounds and music
- Modular level creation/loading system

Notes:
- Windows only
- Requires you to install [OpenAL DLL](https://www.openal.org/downloads/)
- Worked on this for about a month in my free time so it could be improved further
